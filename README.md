# Objective
X Education sells classes online. Lots of people visit their website every day to see the classes. The company advertises on different websites and Google. When people visit the website, they might look at classes, fill out a form, or watch videos. If they fill out a form with their email or phone number, they become leads. The sales team then contacts these leads. Some leads become customers, but most do not. The company wants to find the best leads, called 'Hot Leads', to improve sales. They want to build a model to give each lead a score between 0 and 100. A higher score means the lead is more likely to become a customer. They also want the model to adapt to changes in the future. They provided more details about this in another document. The steps include reading data, cleaning it, exploring it, making categories, splitting the data, building the model, making predictions, evaluating the model, and presenting the findings.
